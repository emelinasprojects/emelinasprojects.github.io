                            <h2>Description</h2>
							<p>Personal project exploring natural language and user behaviour. Sourced from Amazon Fine Foods Kaggle dataset (568K+ reviews across 74K products, 1999–2012), combining ratings, user / product ID and review text.</p>				    
							<h2>Data source</h2>
							<p>The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license (https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement), to download from https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html. I will use historical trip data from 2021 stored across 12 CSV files for each month. BigQuery is used to upload the files individually due to their size ranging from 9MB to 150MB. At a high level, all fields will serve for the analysis except for ride_id and station_id. Ride_id was used to discard possible duplicates before dropping it.<br>
							<h2>Objectives</h2>
							<p>-Drivers to review engagement and helpful reactions.
							-Negative and positive review key themes.<br>	
							-Helpfulness trends (What makes a review helpful?).<br>
							-Yearly and monthly patterns.<br>
							-Recurrent and one-time user behavioural trends.<br>
							<h2>Python Exploratory Analysis Insights</h2>
							<p>-Reviews increased exponentially up to 2012, peaking by 2021, which correlates to product variety increase (Unique Product IDs). October sees the highest average review count, while November sees the lowest.<br>
							-Score: 5 star reviews dominate the dataset consistently, followed by 1 start reviews.<br>
							-Helpfulness: Helpful votes grew 5 times faster and reach 3 times more counts than Non Helpful votes.<br>
							-Users: 80% of users reviewed once while 0,05%% posted >50 reviews. Excessive reviewers gathered more positive scores; reviewing texts revealed potential bots or spam users.<br>
							-Review themes: Reviews cluster around experience, emotion, health, practical value. Most helpful reviews further highlight warnings, ingredients and quality.<br>
							-Longer texts tend to have 5 starts, and 500-1,000 character lengths clutter most helpful reviews, suggesting 20–60 seconds reading time is optimal.<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							A Power BI dashboard was built to visualize relationships among score, text sentiment, reading time, user recurrence and reactions (helpful-non helpful), highlighting volume trends and correlations between review attributes and user feedback.<br>
							Top reviewed products revealed engagement shifts across time showing most reviewed in the last year receive the lowest rating and helpful reaction weight on average.<br>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/dashs_food.png" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Clustering themes in Python lacked insights, so I used keyword frequency sampling to identify prevailing themes, aided by an LLM, and explore user motivations behind posting and reacting to reviews.<br>
